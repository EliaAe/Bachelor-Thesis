\section{Background}\label{section:background}
In 2016, global disasters accounted for USD 175 billion in economic losses. USD 54 billion of these economic losses were insured, resulting in uninsured losses of USD 121 billion \autocite{swissre2017}. These losses highlight the importance of wheather insurance in providing financial protection for individuals, business and governments. For comparison, the international humanitarian assistance reached USD 28 billion in 2015, making the unsinsured losses of 2016 over 4 times that amount \autocite{development2016humanitarian}.




\subsection{Existing Weather Insurance}
Traditional weather insurance primarily consisted of crop insurance. The policy in this contract was typically conducted bilateral between an individual or business and the insurance company. If  a loss incured on the crop of the individual or business due to weather conditions, an assessment had to be done by the insurance company and the insurance payout was  determined based on the specific circumstances \autocite{michler2022risk}.

 Crop insurance has some major problems associated with it. One of these problems is the manual process of analyzing and determining the loss in a monetized amount by an insurance company representative. Other problems include systemic risk, where many insurance holders in the same region are in risk of being affected through weather conditions simultaneously, and asymmetric information, where, for example, insurance holders act more riskily than they normally would because they know they are insured \autocite{makki2002crop}.

 \sloppy A more modern approach to weather insurance compared to the traditional crop insurance is weather-based index insurance. The key difference here is that weather-based index insurance relies on a measurable variable (such as a temperature drop below a certain threshold or a specific amount of rainfall). The underlying weather data is provided by a reference weather station. The goal is for the criteria (e.g. the temperature threshold) to reflect the financial loss experienced by the insurance holder, for example the loss of a corn field due to adverse weather conditions \autocite{kajwang2022weather}.


\section{Problem Statement}\label{section:problem_statement}
Even though the weather-based index insurance approach poses a significant improvement compared to the traditional weather insurance, there are still a lot of problems associated with it. These problems include high administrative costs, delayed payouts, scalability and lack of trust in the underlying systems and insurance companies. \autocite{skees2008challenges}. These limitations reduce accessability and the range of weather insurance solutions for individuals and business, especially in more developing areas.

To address these problems, this thesis proposes a weather insurance solution based on blockchain technology. Through decentralized, transparent systems and globally available weather data, the solution aims to reduce the administrative costs, enable automatic and instant payouts, improve the scalability and encourage more trust among the insurance holders.

\section{Objectives}\label{section:objectives}

The main objective of this thesis is to analyze possible implementations of a blockchain-based weather insurance solution that addresses the challenges and drawbacks of traditional crop insurance und weather-based index insurance. The specific objectives are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify and analyze the key challenges of current weather insurance solutions.
    \item Propose a blockchain-based weather insurance design that utlizes decentralized oracles and globally available weather data.
    \item Evaluate the proposed solution.
    \item Compare the blockchain-based solution to traditional crop insurance and weather-based index solutions to analyze the potential and improvements in efficiency, transparency and user trust.
\end{itemize}
