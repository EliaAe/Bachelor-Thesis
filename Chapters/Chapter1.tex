\section{Background}\label{section:background}
In 2016, global disasters accounted for USD 175 billion in economic losses. USD 54 billion of these economic losses were insured, resulting in uninsured losses of USD 121 billion. These losses underscore the importance of wheather insurance in providing financial protection for individuals, business and governments \autocite{swissre2017}. For comparison, the international humanitarian assistance reached USD 28 billion in 2015, more than 4 times less than the unsinsured losses of 2016 \autocite{development2016humanitarian}.
