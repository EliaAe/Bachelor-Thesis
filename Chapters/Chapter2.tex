\section{Research Design}\label{section:research_design}

The research design for this thesis is primarily exploratory, focusing on collecting and synthesizing information from a variety of sources in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of smart contracts, blockchain technology, Chainlink and the Google Cloud Platform. This research process involved extensive review and analysis of academic papers, articles, documentations and credible online resources with the goal of identifying technical possibilities and practical implications of integrating real-world data onto blockchain-based systems.

The exploratory research design approach was chosen due to the fact that blockchain technology, which is the basis for the proposed system, is still a new topic and not yet established in mainstream technology and society. The flexible and unstructured approach of exploratory research allows the use of various different information sources. This flexibility is crucial to understand the complex connections and interactions between the different technologies and components. Additionally, the rapid development and technological advancement makes it challenging to create structured, enduring documentation. As a result, several components such as GCP Datasets and Chainlink rely on dynamic, short-lived online technical documentation, which is subject to frequent updates and changes by its authors. \autocite{kicsi2022exploratory}




\section{Data Collection}\label{section:data_collection}

In a first step, the economic significance of weather insurance is presented by providing financial costs and losses associated with weather-related disasters. This analysis is based on current reports from reputable international organizations, such as Swiss Re, which regularly publish data on the economic impact of such events. These reports provide the quantitative basis for emphasizing the need for innovative insurance solutions like those explored in this thesis.

Source Selection Criteria: 
Sources were selected based on their relevance to the topic of interest, such as blockchain technology, decentralized oracles, smart contracts and GCP datasets.
