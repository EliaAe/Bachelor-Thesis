\section{Research Design}\label{section:research_design}
The research design for this thesis is primarily exploratory, focusing on collecting and synthesizing information from a variety of sources in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of smart contracts, blockchain technology, Chainlink and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This research process involved extensive review and analysis of academic papers, articles, documentation and credible online resources with the goal of identifying technical possibilities and practical implications of integrating real-world data into blockchain-based systems (see \cref{section:real_world_application_prototype}).

\subsection{Exploratory Research Design}
The exploratory research design approach was chosen because blockchain technology, which is the basis for the proposed system, is still a new topic and not yet established in mainstream technology and society. The flexible and unstructured approach of exploratory research allows the use of various information sources. This flexibility is crucial to understand the complex connections and interactions between the different technologies and components. Additionally, the rapid development and technological advancement make it challenging to create structured, enduring documentation. As a result, several components, such as GCP datasets and Chainlink, rely on dynamic, short-lived online technical documentation, which is subject to frequent updates by its authors \autocite{kicsi2022exploratory}.

\subsection{Scope}
With the aim of developing a blockchain-based insurance system as an alternative to traditional insurance models, the research explores the advantages and opportunities of using blockchain technology compared to traditional methods. The scope encompasses the key limitations of traditional insurance methods (see \cref{section:key_limitations_existing_insurance}) and an analysis of blockchain technology, smart contracts and decentralized oracles (see \cref{chapter:analysis_discussion}). Key areas include policy management, payout mechanisms and the technical challenges of bridging on-chain and off-chain environments. Detailed premium calculation mechanisms are out of scope for this thesis.

\section{Data Collection}\label{section:data_collection}
In a first step, the economic significance of weather insurance is presented by providing financial costs and losses associated with weather-related disasters (see \cref{section:background}). This analysis is based on current reports from reputable international organizations, such as Swiss Re \autocite{swissre2017}, which regularly publishes data on the economic impact of such events. These reports provide the quantitative basis for emphasizing the need for innovative insurance solutions like those explored in this thesis.

Subsequently, qualitative research is conducted to establish the technical and practical foundation for the development of a blockchain-based weather insurance system as an alternative to the traditional model. This research includes an in-depth review of academic literature, industry white papers and technical documentation related to blockchain technology, smart contracts and their application in insurance systems. The qualitative analysis aims to identify potential advantages of using blockchain in weather insurance, such as increased transparency, trust and reduced administrative costs.

By combining qualitative insights with quantitative data, this thesis establishes a comprehensive foundation for designing, implementing and evaluating a blockchain-based weather insurance system compared to a traditional system.

\subsection{Source Selection Criteria}
Sources were selected based on their relevance to the topic of interest, such as blockchain technology, decentralized oracles, smart contracts and GCP datasets. Given the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology and its components, recent and regularly updated sources, such as developer documentation and current reports, were included in the research to ensure technical relevance. Financial aspects of blockchain technology are laid out in more scientifically solid research.

To provide a well-rounded perspective, the research selection included academic literature and scientific papers in addition to the above-mentioned industry reports and documentation. In the analysis chapter, the diverse range of selected research and the findings of the developed prototype are synthesized in order to produce a cohesive and meaningful evaluation.

\subsection{Specific Data Types}
This subsection focuses on the identification and categorization of specific data types essential for the development and evaluation of the blockchain-based weather insurance system. These data types include meteorological data, technical data, economic data and regulatory data. Each category serves a distinct purpose within the system's design and research.

\subsubsection{Meteorological Data}
The data includes real-time and historical weather information, such as temperature, wind speeds and other climate variables. This meteorological data forms the foundation for triggering insurance payouts, making its precision and availability critical to the system's success. Meteorological data is primarily sourced from governmental meteorological agencies, such as GSOD and GFS (see \cref{GSOD}) and made available to the smart contract via the use of decentralized oracles (see \cref{subsection:ChainlinkOracle}).

\subsubsection{Technical Data}
Technical data refers to specific information required to design the blockchain-based weather insurance system and organize its components. This includes information about blockchain technology, smart contracts, Chainlink and GCP. The technical data ensures the system is robust, efficient and fulfills the requirements outlined in \cref{section:requirements}. The primary sources for this data are developer documentation and architectural blueprints about the components used in the blockchain-based system.

\subsubsection{Economic and Regulatory Data}
This data encompasses diverse information types that support the broader objectives of the thesis, particularly in identifying limitations in traditional weather insurance systems and emphasizing the need for robust alternatives. Specifically, these include economic data about the relevance of weather insurance systems, such as financial losses from weather-related disasters. It also includes regulatory data to assess the compliance challenges faced by traditional and blockchain-based systems. Primary sources for this information are academic literature, research papers and current reports.

\section{Key Technologies and Tools}\label{section:prototype_development}
The development of the blockchain-based weather insurance prototype (see \cref{chapter:development_prototype}) required deliberate selection of technologies and tools that align with the objective of developing a blockchain-based prototype that utilizes decentralized oracles and globally available weather data (see \cref{section:objectives}).

\subsection{Etherum Blockchain Technology}
Ethereum was chosen as the underlying blockchain due to its support for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts \autocite{Oliva2020An}. It is widely adopted across both academic and industry settings \autocite{Kosmarski2020Blockchain}. Its ecosystem provides flexible and extensive integration tools, libraries and frameworks, making it a suitable choice for an innovative blockchain-based system. Ethereum's public nature ensures transparency, which is critical for strengthening trust in insurance systems. While alternatives such as Hyperledger Fabric were considered, Ethereum's widespread adoption and compatibility with decentralized oracles made it the preferred option \autocite{ferreira2021regulating}.

\subsection{Smart Contracts}
Smart contracts form the backbone of the system by automating critical functions such as premium calculation, policy management and payout execution. The rationale for their use lies in their ability to eliminate intermediaries, reduce administrative costs and ensure rule-based execution \autocite{Zheng2019An}. By coding the insurance logic directly onto the blockchain, smart contracts provide a transparent and immutable way of enforcing policy terms. Their native support on the Ethereum blockchain makes this choice ideal for achieving the system's objectives of efficiency, transparency and trust.

\subsection{Chainlink}
Chainlink is widely regarded for its ability to securely connect and integrate smart contracts with off-chain data sources through a global, decentralized network of nodes \autocite{breidenbach2021chainlink}. This decentralized nature of Chainlink improves the security, reliability and validity of the data inputs \autocite{beniiche2020study}. The use of traditional centralized APIs was rejected since they represent a single point of failure, which could compromise data integrity and the reliability of the system. To achieve the transparency objectives of this thesis, a decentralized oracle service was chosen. Chainlink's compatibility with Ethereum simplifies the integration process for a functional system and ensures, through its decentralized architecture, that the weather data can securely be retrieved and used to trigger the logic embedded in the smart contract (see \cref{subsection:ChainlinkOracle}).

\subsection{Google Cloud Public Datasets}
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) hosts a wide range of datasets, two of which will be used in this system: the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) and the Global Forecast System (GFS). These datasets provide comprehensive historical and predictive weather data, enabling the proposed blockchain-based weather insurance system to create policies based on the received weather data.

\subsubsection{Global Surface Summary of the Day}\label{GSOD}
Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) will be used as the primary weather data source. Over 9'000 stations provide weather data for the dataset, with each station required to report a minimum of four observations per day of a set of measured variables, including temperature, wind speed, pressure and others. This high frequency, comprehensiveness and global coverage of the GSOD dataset makes it an ideal source for a blockchain-based weather insurance system. The entire dataset is hosted on the GCP and updated daily, ensuring consistent access to the latest weather data. \autocite{NOAA_GSOD_2023}.

\subsubsection{Global Forecast System}\label{GFS}
In addition to GSOD, the prototype also utilizes data from the Global Forecast System (GFS), which provides global weather predictions for up to 16 days. Unlike GSOD, which focuses on historical weather data, GFS is a numerical system based on four different models (atmosphere, ocean, land and sea), which together produce highly accurate and detailed weather forecasts. Similar to GSOD, GFS is hosted on the GCP, allowing for the reutilization of GCP access methods within the system and ensuring access to a comprehensive collection of weather data \autocite{NOAA_GSOD_2020}.
